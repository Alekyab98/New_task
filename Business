Here’s a concise version of your content expressed as business requirements:

Business Requirements for CLLI Mapping and Dashboard Creation:
	1.	CLLI Mapping for Querying:
	•	Enable seamless querying by mapping the CLLI column to FQDNs.
	•	For primary FQDNs, the first 8 characters of the FQDN will be used as the CLLI.
	•	For secondary FQDNs, retrieve the CLLI from the corresponding primary FQDN using the pair column in the static table.
	2.	Traffic Identification:
	•	Ensure traffic originating from primary FQDNs retains the CLLI derived directly from its FQDN.
	•	Map traffic from secondary FQDNs to the CLLI of the paired primary FQDN.
	3.	Target Metrics for Capacity Management:
	•	Create a mapped view to support key metrics for capacity management:
	•	Metric Name
	•	trans_dt
	•	region
	•	apn
	4.	Dashboard Creation:
	•	Enable users to build dashboards for capacity management using the mapped view and the identified key metrics.

This structure clearly communicates the core requirements. Let me know if further refinements are needed!
